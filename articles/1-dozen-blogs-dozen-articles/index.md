# 1. Why am I here?

What am I expecting at being here? well, I'm not really sure but looks like the quality community is here, I want to be able to start sharing my pain and findings here. The only requirement I have sit aht I'm able to do this quick, easy and with as less struggle as possible.

# 2. What will you find here

Mostly short things, I'm not that kind of person that sits down every weekend to sum up what has been doing, before doing that I prefer to do something with my family, I really enjoy that more, really. I won't be taking too much time to publish here, so I'll publish short findings here that can help others, or even better, that can help me to remember hard things/

# 3. Every how often..?

I don't really know, whenever I find something useful, stay tuned in my twitter account, I'm more active over there if you want to know me better.

Bye all!
